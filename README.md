Three Obserable trends based on the data:

1- Nearly half of the players playing or 46.79% are between the Ages of 20-24. Skewed slightly left. 
This means that the games main demographic is skewed towards a younger audiance.
2- All of the most proftiable items are <$4 and all of the most popular items are <$3. New items devolpment should be focused in this range. 
3- The vast majority of our players are males. Although, femaleas and other/ Non-discoled gender spend more in game on average. We should focus to increase these demographics.
